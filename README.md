# Intro
DanceAuth, you and me!

Long since are the days of 'passwords' and '2 factor authentication', welcome to a new era, a better era of 'secure' authentication. (with 65% more running men).

# Tech
Kinect, Zigfu -- an absolute nightmare. We stumbled across a (vaguely) usable library ~ 5 hours into the hack, saving us from embarking on a project with less dabbing.

NodeJS, Express, SocketIO -- used for all of the super cool backend stuff, lots of #spookyspookylogic (according to the comments) for matching against a backlog of previously recorded dance moves.

JS, JQuery, SweetAlert, Animate -- used for our #disco frontend.

# Why?
Our dance moves have been described as no less than 'absolute fire' and 'of questionable standards', this was inspiration enough to release them unto the world.
